# OneBook Project Summary (Memory Anchor)

## Project Overview
OneBook is a Cyberpunk Zen social platform built with Next.js 15+ and Supabase. The project is currently in the late refinement stage, focusing on mobile responsiveness and security.

## Recent Critical Fixes (Unblocking Memory)
- **Next.js 15/16 Compatibility**: All API routes and pages have been updated to support asynchronous `params` and `cookies()`.
- **Supabase Authentication**: Standardized `createServerClient` initialization using the `getAll()` cookie method to resolve Auth Helpers v0.14.0 issues.
- **Build Success**: The project now passes `npm run build` cleanly.

## Active Track: 01-responsive-layout
**Objective**: Optimize the UI for mobile devices while maintaining the BDS (Bolana Design System) aesthetic.
**Status**: Technical dependencies cleared. Initial planning in `conductor/tracks/01-responsive-layout/plan.md`.

## Memory Synchronization
Cloud Neo (Antigravity) has cleared the "卡壳" (stuck) state. Local Neo should now pick up execution from the responsive layout plan.
