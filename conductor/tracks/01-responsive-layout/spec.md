# Track Spec: Mobile Responsive Layout Optimization

## Overview
This track aims to fix layout regressions and responsiveness issues on mobile devices (screens smaller than 768px). The current UI is functional but lacks professional mobile-first navigation and optimal spatial distribution.

## Requirements
1. **Interactive Navigation**: Replace the static text links in the Header with a functional hamburger menu on mobile.
2. **Text Scaling**: Adjust Hero section typography to be readable without overlapping or forcing weird line breaks.
3. **Grid Adaptability**: Change the Home page and Stats page grids to stack components logically on small screens.
4. **Visual Polish**: Ensure glassmorphism effects and buttons maintain their Cyberpunk Zen aesthetic on high-density mobile displays.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on mobile devices (width < 375px).
- [ ] Hamburger menu opens to reveal all nav links (Symbionts, About, Post, Login).
- [ ] Stats cards are displayed in 2 columns (or 1) rather than 4 on mobile.
- [ ] Title text remains "Neo-Noir" and centered on small screens.
